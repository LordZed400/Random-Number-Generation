# Random Number Generation

This program generates random numbers using the `rand()` function, but this function **does not** generate a non-repeating sequence.  
The sequence is made non-repeating using an algorithm that i thought of myself.  
  
- The generated numbers are storred in an array.
- The new random number is checked with all number of the array.
- If the number is already present in the array, generate another number, else store it in the array.
